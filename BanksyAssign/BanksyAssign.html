			<p>Real Time XL The Artist by Maarten Baas is a series of 12-hour films, indicating time by erasing and re-drawing the hands minute by minute. The newest self-portrait in this series, Real Time XL The Artist, shows Maarten Baas, as an artist in his atelier. Created specifically for this exhibition in Leonardo da Vinciâ€™s homeland, exactly 500 years after he passed away, this work celebrates the occasion with a clear reference to the Vitruvian Man.<br><br>
			Simultaneously, by exhibiting a work that unites artistic history and design in Venice during the Biennale, Baas and Carpenters Workshop Gallery both question the arbitrary boundaries of these two creative hemispheres. In doing so, Baas crafts a narrative which addresses different aspects of passing time: getting older, moving forward and looking back.</p> </div>
