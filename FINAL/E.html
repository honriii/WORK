<body>Vans Checkered: First introduced in 1977, the Vans #98—now known as the Classic Slip-On—instantly became an icon in Southern California. Fast forward to today, and the Classic Slip-On is known worldwide for its comfortable silhouette, easy wearability, and beloved design. Featuring the iconic Vans checkerboard print, the Classic Slip-On is an everyday essential with true “Off The Wall” style. This slip-on shoe also includes low profile canvas uppers, supportive padded collars, elastic side accents, and signature rubber waffle outsoles. (Source: Vans)
