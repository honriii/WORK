	One thing that’s to be remembered about the adidas Superstar is that even through it’s most radical reiterations or collabs with big creative names within wider culture, its design has remained more or less the same. Whether as a performance basketball silhouette, a trainer being sky-rocketed into the air by thousands in Madison Square Garden, a sneaker hitting the decks or a collaboration with Prada fuelled by the contemporary multi-billion-dollar reselling scene, the Superstar was, is and always will be a timeless sneaker of great cultural significance.

The original color ways of the Reebok Classic Nylon were white/gray, navy/platinum, and black/white. In 2004, it was reissued in some new color ways. (Source:SneakerFiles) <br><br>
	
	First introduced in 1977, the Vans #98—now known as the Classic Slip-On—instantly became an icon in Southern California.

Featuring the iconic Vans checkerboard print, the Classic Slip-On is an everyday essential with true “Off The Wall” style.
