<body>Reebok: The Reebok Classic Nylon is definitely a heavy weight in the shoe game. It first released in 1987 and its main purpose was for running. It is very simple and affordable. The upper of the Reebok Classic Nylon is made with nylon, hence the name. It features a sculpted EVA midsole which provides lightweight cushioning. The original color ways of the Reebok Classic Nylon were white/gray, navy/platinum, and black/white. In 2004, it was reissued in some new color ways. (Source:SneakerFiles)
